# Enigma

## About:
 - Welcome to Enigma! A Turing Back End Module 1 final project application that will encrypt and decrypt messages. This project is
 based off of the World War II codebreakers. The messages are received by reading file paths from command line input, as well as
 optional keys and dates to be used for the encryption/decryption methods.

## Built With:
 - Ruby Version: 2.7.2p137
 - RSpec Version: 3.10

## Getting Started:
 - Fork/Clone this repo to your computer from GitHub.
  - [Enigma](https://github.com/kevingloss/enigma)

## Testing:
 - If you'd like to run through the test suite just use the rspec spec/<file_name> on any of the spec files.
 - SimpleCov is also used to ensure tests have full coverage.
  - To run the Simplecov report type the following into your terminal: open coverage/index.html
  - See details here: [SimpleCov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov)
  - There are both unit and integration tests for the individual methods and for methods that incorporate several others.

## Challenges & Wins
 - This project was a great experience learning to work with command line input.
